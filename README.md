Hangman game created entirely from scratch. We decided to implement an AI that you can give words to for it to guess them. The game is pretty simple in itself and runs in a Canvas environment. The hangman file in this github contains all the AI attempts and mecanismes written in processing, logic for which we later translated into python (see probs.py). We modified certain things from the AI in the final code to allow more user friendly and simple output.
